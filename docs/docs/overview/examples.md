# Running the example applications

There are several example applications for various Invirt capabilities and use cases
in the [examples](https://github.com/resoluteworks/invirt/tree/main/examples) directory.
All of these are designed as applications that can be built and run.

To run any of these examples, use the `run` script inside this `example` directory.
```shell
cd examples
./run quickstart
```
